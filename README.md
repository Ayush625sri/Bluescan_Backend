# Bluescan_Backend

Bluescan_Backend serves as the core processing engine for our ocean pollution detection system. This sophisticated platform utilizes cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze satellite and drone imagery, specifically focusing on identifying and tracking microplastic pollution patterns in ocean environments.

## Project Overview

Our system harnesses the power of advanced image processing to accomplish several critical tasks in ocean pollution monitoring:

Through careful analysis of satellite and drone imagery, we process vast amounts of ocean surface data to detect microplastic pollution patterns. Our algorithms then generate comprehensive pollution analysis reports, enabling researchers and environmental agencies to track pollution patterns across time and geographic locations. This data-driven approach provides valuable insights for understanding and addressing ocean pollution challenges.

## Technology Stack

We've carefully selected our technology stack to ensure robust performance and scalability:

**Core Technologies:**
- FastAPI: Our choice for building a modern, high-performance API
- PostgreSQL: Powers our reliable data storage system
- Docker: Ensures consistent deployment across environments
- OpenCV & PyTorch: Drive our computer vision capabilities
- JWT Authentication: Provides secure access with Google Sign-In integration

## Prerequisites

Before beginning development, ensure you have:
- Python 3.9 or higher installed
- Docker and Docker Compose configured
- PostgreSQL (for local development)
- Git version control system

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayush625sri/Bluescan_Backend.git
cd Bluescan_Backend
```

2. Configure your environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Customize your .env file with appropriate settings
```

3. Choose your preferred deployment method:

Using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

For local development:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
